# CISC121-Project: Bubble Sort Visual Helper

## Why Bubble Sort?

I chose Bubble Sort because it is one that I have found confusing in the past, but through visual aids, I was able to understand the simplicity of this sorting algorithm. Its logic is very ideal for an educational app as it is easy to work through step by step, each pass has a pattern, and showcasing how the largest values "bubble" to end end is straight forward. My goal is to help beginners learn how Bubble Sort works through a clear and interactive visualization.
